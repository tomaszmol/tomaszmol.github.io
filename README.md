# Personal Portfolio Project – Tomasz Mol  

This is my personal portfolio website project, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. The website is built using modern web technologies and serves as a digital resume and a hub for my work.  

This project was developed as part of the **"Introduction to Web Applications"** course, where I applied front-end development principles and best practices to create a professional online presence.  

## Features  
- **Responsive Design** – Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Projects Showcase** – Highlights selected projects with descriptions and links to repositories.  
- **About Me Section** – Provides an overview of my background, skills, and interests.  
- **Contact Information** – Easy access to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and email for collaboration opportunities.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Core front-end technologies.
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting the portfolio online.
